# Speed Loop Start

Welcome to the Speed Loop system. This framework provides a structured approach to optimizing complex data processing systems.

## Getting Started

To begin your first Speed Loop iteration:

1. **Web Search and Research**: Conduct deep research for improving the efficiency of complex data systems. Use the codebase as context to understand:
   - What are the fundamental components of the system?
   - What are the common bottlenecks in data processing?
   - What optimization techniques apply to this domain?

2. **Create The 10 Commandments**: Based on your research, write a document called `speed_loop/The_10_Commandments.md` that outlines the core principles for optimizing this system. This should include:
   - Fundamental rules that must never be violated
   - Key considerations for maintaining correctness
   - Best practices for performance optimization
   - Guidelines for measuring and verifying improvements

3. **Review the Framework**: Read these documents to understand the Speed Loop methodology:
   - `speed_loop/sacred_rules.md` - The inviolable rules
   - `speed_loop/phase_rules/` - The six phases of optimization

## First Iteration

For your first Speed Loop iteration:

1. Run the system with a canonical test payload
2. Establish baseline metrics
3. Identify the fundamental pieces
4. Proceed through each phase systematically

Remember: **Correctness first, performance second**. Any optimization that breaks output integrity is rejected, no matter how impressive the speedup.
