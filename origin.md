I want to improve the speeds of compute for the maps so to start I want you to make a plan. This plan will be a self verifying loop where we start by understanding the full flow and then we take ideas to improve the speeds of the system you should start by looking at the principles to improve the efficiency of complex data systems and write a dock in a speed loop folder where we call the 10 Commandments.

You can web search these and if you deep research

after that I need you to run an analysis on our system and identify the major points so the fundamental pieces that are necessary to calculate the map like the fundamental resources that are needed for this process to happen

after this list is defined you write a document for this in the same folder

then I want you to set sub agents in parallel to expand on those fundamental pieces to make the same list of fundamental pieces but for the parent fundamental piece this can be listed on your documents with the parents fundamental pieces but describes in a separate document

after that, I want you to analyse with sub agents again how to improve such fundamental pieces in speed

then you’re going to implement changes in a separate testing folder also in this directory so it’s not a temp folder and you’re going to set strategic checkpoint logs to verify if we achieved a negative Delta meaning less time to complete a task while granting the sa

there are sacred rules that you should abide by which is you never lied to yourself that you were able to cut down speeds with the same outputs. the integrity of the mapping algorithm needs to be respected so we are only executing faster the same thing so different results can never be accepted. This should be a Commandment.

after that you run both this server with the test folder directory server the same map request and you’re going to analyse what worked and what didn’t

for the things that did work we need to note them and apply them in the route server

after that, you’re gonna save all of the all of the files from speed loop one into a folder

to start you need to decompose this into a set of rules for the speed loop that our details in a document to tell you how to act in progress the loop accordingly

you’re gonna be setting tasks each time at each phase of the loop so make sure you instruct yourself in those phase documents to set the tasks and revisit the next loop phase file instructions
