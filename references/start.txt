# Speed Loop Start

Welcome to the Speed Loop system. This framework provides a structured approach to optimizing complex data processing systems.

## Getting Started

To begin your first Speed Loop iteration:

1. **Web Search and Research**: Conduct deep research for improving the efficiency of complex data systems with codebase in mind at a high level.

2. **Create The 10 Optimization Commandments**: Based on your research, write a document called `speed_loop/10_optimization_commandments.md` that outlines the core principles for optimizing this system.

3. **Review the Framework**: Read these documents to understand the Speed Loop methodology:
   - `speed_loop/sacred_rules.md` - The inviolable rules
   - `speed_loop/phase_rules/` - The six phases of optimization

4. **Start**: Follow the steps in speed_loop/phase_rules/01_understand.md.
